# Winamp Control Centre
Winamp Control Centre consists of a collection of very small programs that you can use to control Winamp in a variety
of scenarios. For example, you could create a taskbar toolbar that lets you easily pause, play, stop, and change tracks,
etc. Details on how to do this is included in the Readme file. Please note that Winamp3 is not currently supported
(Winamp 5, however, is supported).

For more information see the WinampCC web site at http://www.owenrudge.net/utils/winampcc.
