WINAMP CONTROL CENTRE
Version 1.4.3

Building Winamp Control Centre
==============================

Winamp Control Centre was originally developed with Watcom C/C++, which now
lives on as an open source product, Open Watcom. Open Watcom's home page is
http://www.openwatcom.org/, but as of June 2015 that site appears to be down.
However, an active fork of Open Watcom is available here:

https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2

This includes lots of new features, including a 64-bit Windows hosted version
of Watcom.

To build Winamp Control Centre, simply open the src\winampcc.wpj project in
the Watcom IDE and choose Actions -> Make All.

If you prefer to use another compiler to build WinampCC, you should find it
compiles without much trouble. The source code for the 32-bit application,
WinampCC.exe, is contained within the src\win32 directory, and should build
on any standard Win32 C compiler. Microsoft Visual C++ has been tested
recently with success, although I have not include a project or makefile for
it. Feel free to contribute build scripts or project files to the WinampCC
GitHub project if desired.

The 16-bit version, if anybody is still interested in it, should again build
with any competent compiler - I believe I compiled it with Borland C++ 4.51
some years ago. I expect 16-bit versions of Visual C++ or its predecessors
should also be able to build it.
